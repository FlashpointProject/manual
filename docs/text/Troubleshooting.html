Wait a couple minutes and then retry the download. If the error reappears, it is possible that the component server is either overloaded or down for maintenance; in that case, you can download a zipped copy of Flashpoint from the <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/downloads" target="_blank">download page</a>.

<ol>
    <li>Right-click on the taskbar and select <b>Task Manager</b>.
    <li>In the opened Task Manager window, go to the <b>Details</b> tab.
    <li>Scroll down until you see one or more instances of Flashpoint.exe.
    <li>Select them and then click the <b>End Task</b> button until all Flashpoint.exe instances are gone.

<div class="inner-header">I get an error saying that ffmpeg.dll was not found</div>
<div class="inner-image"><img src="images/ffmpeg.png"></div>
If you have the Avira antivirus installed, add an exception for your Flashpoint folder.
<br><br>
To restore the missing ffmpeg.dll file:
<ol>
    <li>Open Flashpoint Manager by navigating to the Manager folder in the Flashpoint directory and launching FlashpointManager.exe.
    <li>Go to the Update Components tab and click the <b>Install updates</b> button if there are any pending updates. If the launcher was one of the pending updates, you do not need to follow the remaining steps.
    <li>Go to the Settings tab and click the <b>Check for missing files</b> button. The manager will then scan for missing files and the launcher should appear in the list.
    <li>Click the <b>Redownload components</b> button to redownload the launcher component, and with it the missing ffmpeg.dll file.
</ol>

If you originally downloaded Flashpoint using the zipped copy, make sure that the prerequisites listed on the <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/downloads/" target="_blank">download page</a> are installed.
<br><br>
If they are installed and entries are still opening a blank window, it is likely the result of antivirus interference. <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/datahub/Troubleshooting_Antivirus_Interference" target="_blank">Follow this guide</a> to add an antivirus exception for Flashpoint.
