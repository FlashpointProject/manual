<div class="inner-header">Introduction to components</div>
Components are sets of files that provide a specific function, such as allowing the playback of certain entries. Some components depend on other components to operate at the fullest extent. By separating Flashpoint's software suite into individual components, they can be added, removed, and updated independently of each other, saving bandwidth and storage space in the process.
<br><br>
Flashpoint Manager is an application that can be used to add, remove, and update components. It is accessed by clicking the <b>Open Flashpoint Manager</b> button in the bottom left of the launcher. Note that this will close the launcher.
<br><br><br>
<div class="inner-header">Managing components</div>
You can add and remove components in Flashpoint Manager using the Add/Remove Components tab. You will be presented with a similar component list to that of the installer - you can mark components for installation by checking them, or uninstallation by unchecking them. No changes are made to your PC until you click the <b>Apply changes</b> button. You will be notified of any additional dependencies that may need to be installed.
<br><br>
Additionally, components can be updated using the Update Components tab. When a component has a pending update, it will appear in the update list alongside the estimated change in size. Clicking the <b>Install updates</b> button will update every component in the list. (Note that due to the necessity of keeping interoperable components compatible with each other, the manager does not allow you to update individual components.)

<div class="inner-header">Configuring release channels</div>
By default, components are downloaded from the <i>stable</i> release channel. In the stable channel, updates are less frequent and not as likely to introduce new bugs. The alternative is the <i>development</i> channel, where updates are pushed as soon as changes are made. This channel will give you access to new features sooner than the stable channel, but is more likely to introduce bugs. To switch channels, refer to the "Component Source" setting in the Settings tab. When you're finished making changes, click the <b>Save and restart</b> button.
<br><br>
You may notice that there is also a <i>custom</i> Component Source option, which can be used to define unofficial release channels. However, due to the potential of malware being distributed using this method, it should only be used if you absolutely trust the source.
