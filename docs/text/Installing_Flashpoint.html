<div class="inner-header">Choosing a version</div>
There are two editions of Flashpoint that are available on the <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/downloads" target="_blank">download page</a>:
<ul>
    <li><b>Flashpoint Infinity</b> - This lets you view the entire archive on an on-demand basis; entries will only be downloaded to your computer if you play them. This is the smallest and quickest way to experience what Flashpoint has to offer. <b>You need an internet connection to download entries.</b>
    <li><b>Flashpoint Ultimate</b> - This is a snapshot of the entire archive at a certain point of time. It will not fit on most people's computers, so this is probably not what you want unless you're an archivist or someone with a lot of time and hard drive space at your disposal.
</ul>
<br>
<div class="inner-header">Installation Procedure</div>
It is worth noting that Flashpoint is <i>portable software</i>, which means it can be stored in a self-contained folder virtually anywhere on the computer. Uninstallation is as simple as deleting the folder.
<ul>
    <li>If you're downloading <b>Flashpoint Infinity</b>, simply run the .exe to open the installer. You have the option to choose which components you want to be installed, which can be useful if you only want to play certain entries or need to save storage space. The rest of the installation should be straightfoward, and you will be warned of any potential issues or missing dependencies.
    <li>If you're downloading <b>Flashpoint Ultimate</b>, you will need the <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip file manager</a> to extract the contents of the .7z file. While alternatives such as WinRAR also support extracting the contents of .7z files, they should not be used as they have issues with Ultimate's large file size and may not extract properly.
</ul>
Flashpoint will not work in Program Files or any OneDrive-synced folders. For the best results, install Flashpoint to root of the Windows drive or to a drive without an operating system.

<div class="inner-header">Running Flashpoint</div>
If you chose to create shortcuts on the desktop and Start menu during the installation, you can launch Flashpoint using those shortcuts. If not, navigate to the Flashpoint folder in File Explorer and double-click the shortcut inside.
<br><br>
If no window appears, read the section of the <a href="?page=Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> page titled "The Flashpoint window isn't appearing when I run it".

<div class="inner-header">Uninstalling Flashpoint</div>
As previously mentioned, you only need to delete the Flashpoint folder to uninstall Flashpoint. However, if you created a Start menu shortcut during installation, you may want to use the <b>Uninstall Flashpoint</b> button in Flashpoint Manager's Settings tab instead, as it will automatically remove desktop and Start menu shortcuts in addition to Flashpoint itself.
