There is no updater for Flashpoint Infinity at the moment, so you will need to delete and replace your Flashpoint folder. <b>No save data will be wiped when you delete Flashpoint</b>; however, you will need to back up your favorites and any custom playlists if you wish to keep them. You can export a playlist from your current Flashpoint copy by right-clicking the playlist and selecting "Export Playlist". When you open your upgraded Flashpoint copy, you can import it by clicking the "Import Playlist" button under the list of playlists and selecting the exported JSON file.
